# Evaluation Test AI level-02

We've designed a small remote technical test to evaluate your general theoretical knowledge and practical know-how regarding the most used algorithms in Deep Learning. You should not spend more than 24 hours on this, so think strategically about what you want to show.

# Project purpose:

Our aim is to recognize objects from given pictures. The objects are : 'human', 'dogs', 'bike', 'cars', 'flowers', 'horses', 'cats'

# To Do:

1. Loading and preprocess Object dataset(To read images you can use cv2 library).
2. Designing and training a CNN model in Keras.
3. Plotting the Loss and Accuracy curve.
4. Evaluating the model and predicting the output class of a test Object.
5. Plotting the confusion matrix for your result.
